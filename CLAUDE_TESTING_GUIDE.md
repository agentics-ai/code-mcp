# Claude Desktop Testing Guide for VS Code MCP Server

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your VS Code MCP Server is now configured to work with Claude Desktop. Here's how to use it for real code testing:

## 1. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load your MCP server.

## 2. Verify Connection

Once Claude Desktop restarts, you should see your MCP server listed in the available tools. You can verify by asking Claude something like:

"What tools do you have available?"

## 3. Available Tools for Testing

Your MCP server provides these powerful tools for real code testing:

### Workspace Management
- `list_files` - Browse project structure
- `search_files` - Find files by pattern
- `get_workspace_info` - Get project overview

### File Operations
- `read_file` - Read file contents
- `write_file` - Create/modify files
- `delete_file` - Remove files
- `rename_file` - Rename/move files

### Code Execution & Testing
- `execute_command` - Run shell commands
- `run_tests` - Execute test suites
- `npm_command` - Run npm scripts
- `get_diagnostics` - Check for errors/warnings

### Git Operations
- `git_status` - Check repository status
- `git_commit` - Create commits
- `git_branch` - Branch operations
- `git_log` - View commit history

### Advanced Features
- `semantic_search` - AI-powered code search
- `analyze_dependencies` - Dependency analysis
- `performance_profile` - Performance profiling

## 4. Example Testing Workflows

### A. Code Review and Bug Fixing
```
1. "Show me the current project structure"
2. "Search for any TODO comments in the codebase"
3. "Read the main application file and check for potential issues"
4. "Run the test suite to see if there are any failing tests"
5. "Fix any issues found and commit the changes"
```

### B. Feature Development
```
1. "Create a new feature branch for user authentication"
2. "Generate a new service file for handling user login"
3. "Write comprehensive tests for the new service"
4. "Run tests to ensure everything works"
5. "Check code quality and dependencies"
```

### C. Performance Analysis
```
1. "Analyze the current dependencies and check for updates"
2. "Profile the application performance"
3. "Search for any performance bottlenecks in the code"
4. "Suggest optimizations"
```

## 5. Best Practices for Testing

### Start with Project Overview
Always begin by asking Claude to:
- Get workspace information
- List the main files and structure
- Understand the project type and dependencies

### Use Semantic Search
Instead of manually browsing files, use semantic search to find:
- "Find all database connection code"
- "Show me error handling patterns"
- "Locate API endpoint definitions"

### Test Incrementally
- Make small changes
- Run tests after each change
- Use git to track progress

### Verify Results
- Always run tests after modifications
- Check diagnostics for errors
- Review git status before committing

## 6. Sample Testing Session

Here's what a typical testing session might look like:

```
You: "I want to add input validation to my API endpoints. Can you help me analyze the current code and implement proper validation?"

Claude will:
1. Get workspace info to understand your project
2. Search for existing API endpoints
3. Analyze current validation patterns
4. Suggest improvements
5. Implement the changes
6. Write/update tests
7. Run tests to verify everything works
8. Help you commit the changes
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

If the MCP server doesn't appear in Claude Desktop:

1. **Check Configuration**: Verify the config file exists at:
   `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Close and reopen the application

3. **Check Server Path**: Ensure the path in the config points to:
   `/Users/braincraft/Desktop/vscode-mcp-server/dist/src/index.js`

4. **Test Server Manually**: Run this command to test:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/braincraft/Desktop/vscode-mcp-server
   node dist/src/index.js
   ```

## 8. Advanced Usage

### Multiple Workspaces
You can use the MCP server to work with different projects by:
- Using absolute paths in commands
- Switching working directories
- Managing multiple git repositories

### Integration Testing
Perfect for testing integrations between:
- Frontend and backend code
- Database connections
- External API integrations
- Microservices communication

### Continuous Development
Use Claude Desktop as your AI pair programmer:
- Real-time code review
- Automated testing
- Refactoring assistance
- Documentation generation
